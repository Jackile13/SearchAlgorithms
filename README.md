A WinUI (Windows Desktio) application that visualises 4 search algorithms: BFS, DFS, Greedy Best First Search and A*.

To change the map, edit the map variable in the `MainPage.xaml.cs` file. If the dimensions of the map change, edit the `NumCols` resource in `MainPage.xaml`. 
The size of the tiles in the grids can be changed by adjusting the rectangle height and widths and the `TileSize` resource in `MainPage.xaml` also.

In the future, the sizing of the grids will be handled automatically.
